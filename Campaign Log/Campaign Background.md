We are on the Sword Coast, in Baldur's Gate. (The Mos Eisley of the Sword Coast, a seaside town scourged by vipers and villains.)

#### A Dark Secret
The entire party shares a dark secret.  A decade ago, we schemed together to steal a nights worth of earnings from [The Low Lantern](Locations/The%20Low%20Lantern.md), the proprietor of which has contracted a gang of [The Kenku Killers](Factions/The%20Kenku%20Killers.md) that still haunts our trails and our nightmares a decade later.

* [Iliran Tilorri - Mike](Umbra%20Contundens/Iliran%20Tilorri%20-%20Mike.md) was *The Breaker*.  Force was his specialty, breaking through walls and breaking bones.  He has since dedicated his life to learning with a focus on wizardry and alternate planes
*  [Baktha Tassup - Ryan](Umbra%20Contundens/Baktha%20Tassup%20-%20Ryan.md) was *The Burglar*.  The money may have belonged to [The Low Lantern](Locations/The%20Low%20Lantern.md), but all he needed to do was reach out and grab it.  He has since dedicated himself to [Torm](Torm) and has become quite the Dudley.  
- [Thomus - Thomas](Umbra%20Contundens/Thomus%20-%20Thomas.md) was *The Distraction*.  He sang an aria for the patrons of [The Low Lantern](Locations/The%20Low%20Lantern.md) while we pilfered the managers office of gold.  He has since gone on the 'roids' and bulked up.  Last I heard, he was a brawler or something.
- [Salah Secumber - Hal](Umbra%20Contundens/Salah%20Secumber%20-%20Hal.md) was *The Lockpicker*.  He jimmied the door to the office.
- I, [Ira Ferox - Josh](Umbra%20Contundens/Ira%20Ferox%20-%20Josh.md), was *The Lookout*.  After all, watching out for trouble is the best way to avoid it.  I made sure the manager stayed busy and had no cause to visit the office.  

After the [The Kenku Killers](Factions/The%20Kenku%20Killers.md) failed to exact revenge, the owner of [The Low Lantern](Locations/The%20Low%20Lantern.md) tried to exact justice by calling the [The Flaming Fist](Factions/The%20Flaming%20Fist.md) and offering a reward.  It's been long enough now the heat has long since died down.  I'm actually back in Baldur's Gate, unimpeded.  

## Current Events
[Elturel](Locations/Elturel.md), the capital of [Elturgard](Locations/Elturgard.md), has fallen *very recently*.  Nobody knows why, but we have begun to see an influx of refugees over the past few days.  [The Flaming Fist](Factions/The%20Flaming%20Fist.md) has seen a large expansion of power in the days since and have sealed the gates allowing nobody in or out. Their Grand Duke, [Ulder Ravenguard](NPCs/Ulder%20Ravenguard.md) has gone missing.  Locals are afraid Baldur's Gate will suffer the same fate as [Elturel](Locations/Elturel.md).  Rumor is it's just a smoking pit now.  

We have just been drafted by [The Flaming Fist](Factions/The%20Flaming%20Fist.md) to help defend the city.  We were ordered to talk to [Darmin Zodge (Captain)](NPCs/Darmin%20Zodge%20(Captain).md) currently perched at the Basilisk Gate.  He asks us to assist with a problem while [The Flaming Fist](Factions/The%20Flaming%20Fist.md) maintains order.  

He assigns us  our first mission:  [Mission 1 - Kill the Dead Three's Acolytes](Campaign%20Log/Mission%201%20-%20Kill%20the%20Dead%20Three's%20Acolytes.md)
