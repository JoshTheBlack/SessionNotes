We are on the Sword Coast, in Baldur's Gate. (The Mos Eisley of the Sword Coast, a seaside town scourged by vipers and villains.)

#### A Dark Secret
The entire party shares a dark secret.  A decade ago, we schemed together to steal a nights worth of earnings from [[The Low Lantern]], the proprietor of which has contracted a gang of [[kenku killers]] that still haunts our trails and our nightmares a decade later.

* [[Iliran Tilorri (Elf Wizard, Mike)]] was *The Breaker*.  Force was his specialty, breaking through walls and breaking bones.  He has since dedicated his life to learning with a focus on wizardry and alternate planes
*  [[Baktha Tassup (Elf Paladin, Ryan)]] was *The Burglar*.  The money may have belonged to [[The Low Lantern]], but all he needed to do was reach out and grab it.  He has since dedicated himself to [[Torm]] and has become quite the Dudley.  
- [[Thomus (Unknown Warpriest, Thomas)]] was *The Distraction*.  He sang an aria for the patrons of [[The Low Lantern]] while we pilfered the managers office of gold.  He has since gone on the 'roids' and bulked up.  Last I heard, he was a brawler or something.
- [[Salah Secumber (Human Cleric, Hal)]] was *The Lockpicker*.  He jimmied the door to the office.
- I, [[Ira Ferox (Human Fighter, Josh)]], was *The Lookout*.  After all, watching out for trouble is the best way to avoid it.  I made sure the manager stayed busy and had no cause to visit the office.  

After the [[kenku killers]] failed to exact revenge, the owner of [[The Low Lantern]] tried to exact justice by calling the [[The Flaming Fist]] and offering a reward.  It's been long enough now the heat has long since died down.  I'm actually back in Baldur's Gate, unimpeded.  

## Current Events
[[Elturel]], the capital of [[Elturgard]], has fallen *very recently*.  Nobody knows why, but we have begun to see an influx of refugees over the past few days.  [[The Flaming Fist]] has seen a large expansion of power in the days since and have sealed the gates allowing nobody in or out. Their Grand Duke, [[Ulder Ravenguard]] has gone missing.  Locals are afraid Baldur's Gate will suffer the same fate as [[Elturel]].  Rumor is it's just a smoking pit now.  

We have just been drafted by [[The Flaming Fist]] to help defend the city.  We were ordered to talk to [[Darmin Zodge (Captain)]] currently perched at the Basilisk Gate.  He asks us to assist with a problem while [[The Flaming Fist]] maintains order.  

He assigns us  our first mission:  [[Mission 1 - Kill the Dead Three's Acolytes]]
