#### The plan
We put together a plan to do some recon.  
We filter into the bathhouse one at a time, spread out over some 30-45 minutes.  

#### The Trip
We hear a lot of speculation about the fate of [[Elturel]] on our short jaunt to the split up point.

#### The Recon
[[The Bathhouse]] is a large stucco building with a clay-tiled roof with a courtyard.
[[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] goes first.  [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]] follows shortly behind.  
[[Thomus - Thomas]] visits one of the massage rooms, receiving a massage from the therapist Qurmilah, who tells [[Thomus - Thomas]] that the faucet draws warm water from some sort of elaborate pipe system under the building.  He notices a false wall in the massage room.

There are half a dozen common folk bathing in the shallow pools inside, but no attendant in sight.
[[Salah Secumber - Hal]] visitz Jabaz in the other massage chamber.

#### The Docks
We depart the bath house with a plan to come back after dark.  We head to the docks to check out the [[Uncivil Serpent]].

[[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] offers to have his father outfit the ship and sail it under his banners in exchange for donating the ship when we are done with it.

#### The Infiltration
As the inky cloak of night descended, we returned to the imposing bathhosue, seeking a clandestine entry. Our path led us to a secluded window at the rear of the structure, where the agile [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] ascended with the aid of a boost and skillfully pried open the window. Alas, just as he cast down the rope, our presence was discovered!

Three figures, garbed in crimson robes as dark as the abyss itself, materialized from the shadows and converged upon [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]]. Their blades flashed, inflicting grievous wounds upon him thrice, but with a clap of his hands and a resounding boom, he unleashed a thunderous wave, hurling one assailant back through the doorway and into the watery bath beyond. The remaining two were dashed against the unforgiving stone walls, collapsing in a crumpled heap.

With haste, I ascended the rope, my heart pounding in my chest. "Are they vanquished?" I inquired of [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]], before inadvertently striking one of his wounds in my exuberance.

The fallen foe before me stirred, attempting to rise, but my blade descended in a swift arc, cleaving his skull in twain. Two more adversaries surged through the doorway, their weapons aimed at [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] and myself. A dagger found its mark, burying itself deep in Iliran's breast, while the second assailant's eyes flickered with an eerie green luminescence as he unleashed a beam of stygian energy, narrowly missing me. Later, I would learn that this was a malevolent spell of necromantic power.

But hope was not lost! [[Thomus - Thomas]] and [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]] burst into the fray, followed by the valiant [[Salah Secumber - Hal]], who launched himself from the window ledge, tackling one of the attackers to the ground.

Enraged by the necromancer's assault, I charged towards him, intending to hurl him into the awaiting pool. Yet, he stood firm as an ironclad bastion, unyielding to my efforts. Undeterred, I unsheathed my shortsword, its keen edge slicing through his throat, silencing his dark incantations. [[Thomus - Thomas]] dispatched the remaining straggler, and we claimed the spoils of victory from the lifeless forms of our enemies.
#### The Dungeon
Descending into the subterranean depths, we found ourselves wading through frigid waters that lapped at our knees. The air hung heavy with the oppressive weight of dampness and decay. Amidst this somber scene, a hidden passageway beckoned, promising secrets long forgotten.

Venturing forth, we stumbled upon a chamber, its silence broken only by the gentle lapping of water against the stone walls. There, floating amidst the murky depths, lay a bloated corpse, its pallid flesh bearing the grim testament of a demise some two days past. The sight was a stark reminder of the ephemeral nature of life, a chilling memento mori in the heart of the flooded basement.
