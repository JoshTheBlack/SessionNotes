#### The plan
We put together a plan to do some recon.  
We filter into the bathhouse one at a time, spread out over some 30-45 minutes.  

#### The Trip
We hear a lot of speculation about the fate of [[Elturel]] on our short jaunt to the split up point.

#### The Recon
[[The Bathhouse]] is a large stucco building with a clay-tiled roof with a courtyard.
[[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] goes first.  [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]] follows shortly behind.  
[[Thomus - Thomas]] visits one of the massage rooms, receiving a massage from the therapist Qurmilah, who tells [[Thomus - Thomas]] that the faucet draws warm water from some sort of elaborate pipe system under the building.  He notices a false wall in the massage room.

There are half a dozen common folk bathing in the shallow pools inside, but no attendant in sight.
[[Salah Secumber - Hal]] visitz Jabaz in the other massage chamber.

#### The Docks
We depart the bath house with a plan to come back after dark.  We head to the docks to check out the [[Uncivil Serpent]].

[[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] offers to have his father outfit the ship and sail it under his banners in exchange for donating the ship when we are done with it.

#### The Infiltration
As the inky cloak of night descended, we returned to the imposing bathhosue, seeking a clandestine entry. Our path led us to a secluded window at the rear of the structure, where the agile [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] ascended with the aid of a boost and skillfully pried open the window. Alas, just as he cast down the rope, our presence was discovered!

Three figures, garbed in crimson robes as dark as the abyss itself, materialized from the shadows and converged upon [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]]. Their blades flashed, inflicting grievous wounds upon him thrice, but with a clap of his hands and a resounding boom, he unleashed a thunderous wave, hurling one assailant back through the doorway and into the watery bath beyond. The remaining two were dashed against the unforgiving stone walls, collapsing in a crumpled heap.

With haste, I ascended the rope, my heart pounding in my chest. "Are they vanquished?" I inquired of [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]], before inadvertently striking one of his wounds in my exuberance.

The fallen foe before me stirred, attempting to rise, but my blade descended in a swift arc, cleaving his skull in twain. Two more adversaries surged through the doorway, their weapons aimed at [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] and myself. A dagger found its mark, burying itself deep in Iliran's breast, while the second assailant's eyes flickered with an eerie green luminescence as he unleashed a beam of stygian energy, narrowly missing me. Later, I would learn that this was a malevolent spell of necromantic power.

But hope was not lost! [[Thomus - Thomas]] and [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]] burst into the fray, followed by the valiant [[Salah Secumber - Hal]], who launched himself from the window ledge, tackling one of the attackers to the ground.

Enraged by the necromancer's assault, I charged towards him, intending to hurl him into the awaiting pool. Yet, he stood firm as an ironclad bastion, unyielding to my efforts. Undeterred, I unsheathed my shortsword, its keen edge slicing through his throat, silencing his dark incantations. [[Thomus - Thomas]] dispatched the remaining straggler, and we claimed the spoils of victory from the lifeless forms of our enemies.
#### The Dungeon
Descending into the subterranean depths, we found ourselves wading through frigid waters that lapped at our knees. The air hung heavy with the oppressive weight of dampness and decay. Amidst this somber scene, a hidden passageway beckoned, promising secrets long forgotten.

Venturing forth, we stumbled upon a chamber, its silence broken only by the gentle lapping of water against the stone walls. There, floating amidst the murky depths, lay a bloated corpse, its pallid flesh bearing the grim testament of a demise some two days past. The sight was a stark reminder of the ephemeral nature of life, a chilling memento mori in the heart of the flooded basement.

------------------------------------

An eastward passageway led us to a chamber of grim spectacle. A sacrificial altar, slick with blood and viscera, dominated the space, crowned with a human skull contorted in an unnatural grimace of perpetual agony. A palpable sense of dread clung to the air, whispering of dark rituals and unspeakable sacrifices.

Just south, an alcove displayed a large tapestry woven with a chilling scene: four faceless figures engaged in the brutal dismemberment of a fifth. With an ill-fated touch, [[Salah Secumber - Hal]] unleashed the tapestry's hidden curse. It erupted in a cloud of noxious yellow spores, inflicting him with a debilitating poison that wracked his body with agonizing pain.

The path, rising from the stagnant water, culminated in an octagonal chamber, three imposing doors set into its walls. Each door bore the image of a deity: [[Bhaal]], the Lord of Murder, leered from the north; [[Bane]], the Black Hand, scowled from the east; and [[Myrkul]], the Lord of Bones, gazed with hollow eyes from the south.

With a boldness that bordered on recklessness, [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]] threw open the north door, revealing a passage that looped back to the entrance. [[Ira Ferox - Josh]], drawn by the dark allure of Bane, opened the eastern door. Beyond lay a long hallway, punctuated by short flights of stairs, that snaked its way to a small, waterlogged chamber before curving southward. Meanwhile, [[Thomus - Thomas]], ever the curious one, unsealed the southern door.

Within, three robed figures lay in a triangular formation, a single torch flickering between them. As [[Thomus - Thomas]] intruded upon their slumber, one of the figures stirred, fixing him with a malevolent glare. With characteristic impulsiveness, [[Salah Secumber - Hal]] charged into the fray, his weapon crushing the skull of one of the figures before it could even rise. [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] unleashed a fiery bolt, rousing the remaining two figures who sprang to their feet, lashing out at [[Salah Secumber - Hal]]. But Salah, with the agility of a seasoned warrior, evaded their clumsy attacks, turning their aggression against them. He swiftly dispatched another, while [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] weakened the last with scorching magic. [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]], eager to join the fight, accidentally singed his own eyebrows in his haste to contribute. Finally, [[Thomus - Thomas]] finished the last cultist with a well-aimed firebolt.

Beyond the chamber of slumbering cultists, we discovered a looted sarcophagus, its contents scattered. Within lay three leather-bound spellbooks: a crimson tome containing spells of fire and illusion; a brown book, marked with a personal rune, filled with enchantments and arcane utility; and a third, bound in black scales, brimming with spells of darkness and shadow.

Returning to the eastern path, we arrived at a flooded chamber. Ascending a short flight of stairs, we were met with a gruesome sight: a battered elf, bound in chains, was being tormented by two sinister figures. A woman clad in chainmail, wielding a wooden shield, and a hulking brute in a plate helm and chain shirt stood over him, their faces contorted in cruel delight.

The battle that ensued was a whirlwind of steel and magic. [[Salah Secumber - Hal]] launched a guiding bolt at the brute, but his aim was off. [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] scored a glancing blow with a firebolt. The woman, who we later learned was called [[The Fist of Bane]], spun around and swung wildly at [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]], missing her mark. [[Ira Ferox - Josh]] landed a glancing blow with his shortsword, but his second swing went wide. The brute, known as [[The Iron Consult]], roared with monstrous fury, provoking [[The Fist of Bane]] to attack again.

We traded blows with the torturers, a chaotic dance of death in the confined space. Finally, [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]] struck a fatal blow, ending the reign of [[The Fist of Bane]]. After a fierce exchange, [[Salah Secumber - Hal]] landed the killing blow on [[The Iron Consult]], freeing the tormented elf from his suffering.

Our attention was drawn to a suit of armor in the chamber, its gauntlets etched with arcane inscriptions. A burlap sack lay hidden behind its legs. Upon closer inspection, the gauntlets pulsed with magical energy, an enchantment of animation clinging to them. With a touch, [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] unwittingly activated the gauntlets, which detached from the armor and launched a furious assault.

The animated gauntlets proved to be formidable foes, delivering a sound thrashing before we finally managed to destroy them. We licked our wounds, nursing our bruises and battered pride. Unfortunately, the animated gauntlets had managed to knock [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] unconscious before their demise.
