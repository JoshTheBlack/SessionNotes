#### The plan
We put together a plan to do some recon.  
We filter into the bathhouse one at a time, spread out over some 30-45 minutes.  

#### The Trip
We hear a lot of speculation about the fate of [Elturel](Locations/Elturel.md) on our short jaunt to the split up point.

#### The Recon
The bathhouse is a large stucco building with a clay-tiled roof with a courtyard.
[Iliran Tilorri - Mike](Umbra%20Contundens/Iliran%20Tilorri%20-%20Mike.md) goes first.  [Baktha Tassup - Ryan](Umbra%20Contundens/Baktha%20Tassup%20-%20Ryan.md) follows shortly behind.  
[Thomus - Thomas](Umbra%20Contundens/Thomus%20-%20Thomas.md) visits one of the massage rooms, receiving a massage from the therapist [Qurmilah](Qurmilah), who tells [Thomus - Thomas](Umbra%20Contundens/Thomus%20-%20Thomas.md) that the faucet draws warm water from some sort of elaborate pipe system under the building.  He notices a false wall in the massage room.

There are half a dozen common folk bathing in the shallow pools inside, but no attendant in sight.
[Salah Secumber - Hal](Umbra%20Contundens/Salah%20Secumber%20-%20Hal.md) visitz [Jabaz](Jabaz) in the other massage chamber.

#### The Docks
We depart the bath house with a plan to come back after dark.  We head to the docks to check out the [Uncivil Serpent](Locations/Uncivil%20Serpent.md).

[Iliran Tilorri - Mike](Umbra%20Contundens/Iliran%20Tilorri%20-%20Mike.md) offers to have his father outfit the ship and sail it under his banners in exchange for donating the ship when we are done with it.

#### The Infiltration
We come back after dark and eventually find a way inside through the window in the back right of the building.  We hoist up [Iliran Tilorri - Mike](Umbra%20Contundens/Iliran%20Tilorri%20-%20Mike.md), he crowbars open the window and throws down a rope just in time to be discovered!
