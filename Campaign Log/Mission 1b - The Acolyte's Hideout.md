#### The plan
We put together a plan to do some recon.  
We filter into the bathhouse one at a time, spread out over some 30-45 minutes.  

#### The Trip
We hear a lot of speculation about the fate of [[Elturel]] on our short jaunt to the split up point.

#### The Recon
The bathhouse is a large stucco building with a clay-tiled roof with a courtyard.
[[Iliran Tilorri (Elf Wizard- Mike)]] goes first.  [[Baktha Tassup (Elf Paladin- Ryan)]] follows shortly behind.  
[[Thomus (Unknown Warpriest- Thomas)]] visits one of the massage rooms, receiving a massage from the therapist [[Qurmilah]], who tells [[Thomus (Unknown Warpriest- Thomas)]] that the faucet draws warm water from some sort of elaborate pipe system under the building.  He notices a false wall in the massage room.

There are half a dozen common folk bathing in the shallow pools inside, but no attendant in sight.
[[Salah Secumber (Human Cleric- Hal)]] visitz [[Jabaz]] in the other massage chamber.

#### The Docks
We depart the bath house with a plan to come back after dark.  We head to the docks to check out the [[Uncivil Serpent]].

[[Iliran Tilorri (Elf Wizard- Mike)]] offers to have his father outfit the ship and sail it under his banners in exchange for donating the ship when we are done with it.

#### The Infiltration
We come back after dark and eventually find a way inside through the window in the back right of the building.  We hoist up [[Iliran Tilorri (Elf Wizard- Mike)]], he crowbars open the window and throws down a rope just in time to be discovered!
