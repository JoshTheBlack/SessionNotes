### Reward: 200g each, as well as [[Captain Darmin Zodge]]'s gratitude.

Baldur's gate has long been plagued by followers of the [[Dead Three]].  

We have been tasked to searching them out and killing them, along with anyone who gets in the way.  Collateral damage is fine.  

[[Tarina, Spy]], a spy who hangs out at the [[Elfsong Tavern]], can give us some info on the [[Dead Three]].  [[Captain Darmin Zodge]] recommends we treat her nice, because she has dangerous friends.

We enter the tavern and sit at a table near the bar.  There is an animated suit of armor with nobody visible inside.

We overheard talk of who will be the next Grand Duke.  [[Thalamra Vanthampur]] seems to be a top contender.  She is born of the sewer and rumored to be quite vicious.  One of the four dukes on the council of four.  

[[Falten, Barkeep]] comes over and takes our order.  
Hal asks for [[Tarina, Spy]] and [[Faltin]] seems a little taken aback by that request.  He grabs our order and tells us she is upstairs.  She is playing Baldur's Bones in the loft.  

[[Tarina, Spy]] seems relieved when we ask about information on [[Dead Three]].  The information will cost us a bit of protective action.  She has stolen from some unsavory individuals and needs backup as her comeuppance is nigh. 8-10 scoundrels, her former crew.

We rent the largest room and set a trap for them.

Oshallah is in the largest room, so we rent the room above the bay window.

When the ghostly Elvish song the tavern is known for was sung, the lyrics were different than they normally are.  They were:

>*O sing a song of Elturel*
*Of water, woods, and hill*
*The sun dawns on her ruddy cliffs*
*And fields green and still.*
*This land of long-abiding joy*
*Home of the strong and brave*
*Renowned by all, across the realms,*
*And never once a slave.*
>
>*O sing a song of Elturel*
*When foes are at her door*
*Her fields torn by cloven feet*
*From some infernal shore.*
*Arise the mighty Hellriders*
*Take up your swift, keen swords*
*Then charge into the hellish fray*
*And scatter devil hordes.*
>
>*O sing a song of Elturel*
*And when the night does fall*
*Sleep safe beneath Companion's light*
*Until the dawn does call.*
*We're bound by mortal covenant*
*That only ends with death*
*And so we'll sing of Elturel*
*Until our final breath.*

The [[Hellriders]] sung of in the song are Paladins sworn to protect Elturel.  It has been speculated that they fought their way into Hell itself.

### The Fight
We hear a bit of a commotion arise downstairs and steel ourselves for a potential conflict.

Captain Sesprin (Deadeye) is shocked at the trap we have sprung for him.
Baktha makes the first kill, taking down one of the goons with a single blow.  Iliran the second, then all of Sesprin's companians drop their weapons.  We dispatch ourselves of Captain Sesprin fairly quickly while his hired swords flee in fear.
Thomus took an awful blow and fell unconscious, so we took some time to heal him up.  

The barkeep is unhappy with the mess.  He bans [[Tarina, Spy]] permanently, but allows her to stay the night.
