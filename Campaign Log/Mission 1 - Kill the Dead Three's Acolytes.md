### Reward: 200g each, as well as [[Captain Darmin Zodge]]'s gratitude.

Baldur's gate has long been plagued by followers of the [[Dead Three]].  

We have been tasked to searching them out and killing them, along with anyone who gets in the way.  Collateral damage is fine.  

[[Tarina, Spy]], a spy who hangs out at the [[Elfsong Tavern]], can give us some info on the [[Dead Three]].  [[Captain Darmin Zodge]] recommends we treat her nice, because she has dangerous friends.

We enter the tavern and sit at a table near the bar.  There is an animated suit of armor with nobody visible inside.

We overheard talk of who will be the next Grand Duke.  [[Thalamra Vanthampur]] seems to be a top contender.  She is born of the sewer and rumored to be quite vicious.  One of the four dukes on the council of four.  

[[Falten, Barkeep]] comes over and takes our order.  
Hal asks for [[Tarina, Spy]] and [[Faltin]] seems a little taken aback by that request.  He grabs our order and tells us she is upstairs.  She is playing Baldur's Bones in the loft.  

[[Tarina, Spy]] seems relieved when we ask about information on [[Dead Three]].  The information will cost us a bit of protective action.  She has stolen from some unsavory individuals and needs backup as her comeuppance is nigh. 8-10 scoundrels, her former crew.

We rent the largest room and set a trap for them.
