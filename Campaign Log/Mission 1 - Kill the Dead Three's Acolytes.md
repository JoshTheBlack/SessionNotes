## Reward: 200g each, as well as [[Darmin Zodge (Captain)]]'s gratitude.

#### Background
Baldur's gate has long been plagued by followers of the [[Dead Three]].  

We have been tasked to searching them out and killing them, along with anyone who gets in the way.  Collateral damage is fine.  

[[Tarina (Spy)]], a spy who hangs out at the [[Elfsong Tavern]], can give us some info on the [[Dead Three]].  [[Darmin Zodge (Captain)]] recommends we treat her nice, because she has dangerous friends.

#### Reconnaissance 1A
We enter the tavern and sit at a table near the bar.  There is an animated suit of armor with nobody visible inside.

We overheard talk of who will be the next Grand Duke.  [[Thalamra Vanthampur]] seems to be a top contender.  She is born of the sewer and rumored to be quite vicious.  One of the four dukes on the council of four.  

[[Falten (Barkeep)]] comes over and takes our order.  
[[Salah Secumber (Human Cleric, Hal)]] asks for [[Tarina (Spy)]] and [[Falten (Barkeep)]] seems a little taken aback by that request.  He grabs our order and tells us she is upstairs.  She is playing Baldur's Bones in the loft.  

[[Tarina (Spy)]] seems relieved when we ask about information on [[Dead Three]].  The information will cost us a bit of protective action.  She has stolen a large sum from her former crewmates aboard the *Uncivil Serpent* and needs backup as her comeuppance is nigh.

We rent a room and set a trap for them.

[[Oshallah]] is in the largest room, so we rent the room above the bay window.

When the ghostly Elvish song the tavern is known for was sung, the lyrics were different than normal.  Instead of the standard love ballad they were a song about Elturel.

> [!quote]- The Lyrics
> *O sing a song of [[Elturel]]*
*Of water, woods, and hill*
*The sun dawns on her ruddy cliffs*
*And fields green and still.*
*This land of long-abiding joy*
*Home of the strong and brave*
*Renowned by all, across the realms,*
*And never once a slave.*
>
>*O sing a song of [[Elturel]]*
*When foes are at her door*
*Her fields torn by cloven feet*
*From some infernal shore.*
*Arise the mighty [[Hellriders]]*
*Take up your swift, keen swords*
*Then charge into the hellish fray*
*And scatter devil hordes.*
>
>*O sing a song of [[Elturel]]*
*And when the night does fall*
*Sleep safe beneath Companion's light*
*Until the dawn does call.*
*We're bound by mortal covenant*
*That only ends with death*
*And so we'll sing of [[Elturel]]*
*Until our final breath.*

The [[Hellriders]] sung of in the song are Paladins sworn to protect Elturel.  It has been speculated that they fought their way into Hell itself.

#### The Fight for [[Tarina (Spy)]]'s Life
We hear a bit of a commotion arise downstairs and steel ourselves for a potential conflict.

| ![[Captain Sesprin.png]] | ![[Bandit.png]] |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |

[[Murosko Sesprin (Captain)]] (Deadeye) and his band of lackeys clamber up the stairs, gruffly asking where [[Tarina (Spy)]] is, unwise to the trap we have set for them.  I casually point to the room where we have tucked [[Tarina (Spy)]] and [[Thomus (Unknown Warpriest, Thomas)]] as the rest of [[=Umbra Contundens=]]  pretends to play bones.
[[Murosko Sesprin (Captain)]] kicks open the door, springing the trap we have set.  Immediately beset by violence, he is briefly stunned.
[[Baktha Tassup (Elf Paladin, Ryan)]] makes the first kill, taking down one of the goons with a single blow.  
[[Iliran Tilorri (Elf Wizard, Mike)]] claims the second kill, then all of [[Murosko Sesprin (Captain)]] companions drop their weapons.  
We dispatch ourselves of [[Murosko Sesprin (Captain)]] fairly quickly while his hired swords flee in fear.

#### The Aftermath in [[Elfsong Tavern]]
[[Thomus (Unknown Warpriest, Thomas)]] took an awful blow and fell unconscious, so we took some time to heal him up and bandage the rest of our wounds.  

The barkeep is unhappy with the mess.  He bans [[Tarina (Spy)]] permanently, but allows her to stay the night.

### The Intel 
The [[Dead Three]]'s acolytes are believed to be hiding in a public bathhouse several blocks north of here.  It can be identified by the frolicking nymphs carved in its gates.  Rumor is there is a secret door inside leads to a dungeon.  
The bathhouse is run by the family of [[Thalamra Vanthampur]].  The day to day is run by [[Mortlock Vanthampur]].

We begin planning for [[Mission 1b - The Acolyte's Hideout]].
