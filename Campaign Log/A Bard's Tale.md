In Baldur's Gate, where shadows dwell,
A tale of theft, a secret fell.
Five rogues, with cunning and with guile,
Stole from the Lantern, for a while.

The Kenku Killers, on their trail,
Sought vengeance, but their efforts failed.
The Flaming Fist, with iron hand,
Sought justice, throughout the land.

Years passed, the heat died down,
But fate's cruel hand did darkly frown.
Elturel fell, a smoking pit,
And Baldur's Gate, in fear did sit.

The Dead Three's cult, a lurking threat,
Their acolytes, we must beset.
In Elfsong Tavern, whispers rise,
Of hidden foes, and dark allies.

Tarina, spy, with secrets deep,
Her life in danger, we must keep.
A trap is set, a fight ensues,
And victory, our strength renews.

The bathhouse beckons, nymphs in sight,
Where evil lurks, in darkest night.
Through secret doors, we make our way,
To vanquish foes, and seize the day.

In flooded depths, and chambers grim,
We face our fears, with courage dim.
The Dead Three's acolytes, we find,
And with our blades, their souls unbind.

But dangers lurk, in every room,
A necromancer, seals our doom.
With fire and spell, she takes her stand,
But falls at last, by our brave hand.

A spectral skull, with haunting gaze,
Marks us with fear, in dark amaze.
Our quest continues, fraught with dread,
As shadows gather, overhead.
