## The Ransom
We set off to deliver the sniveling [[Amrik Vanthampur]] back to his mummy, anticipating a hefty reward for our troubles. The ever-earnest [[Reya Mantlemorn]] tagged along, radiating righteous indignation. Navigating the heavily guarded gates of the Upper City proved laughably simple; our [[Flaming Fist]] credentials parted the guards like smoke.

Vanthampur Villa itself presented a similar, albeit private, display of martial readiness. [[Amrik Vanthampur|Amrik]], still clinging to his delusions of authority, waved us through his family's personal guards. Inside the opulent entrance hall, Amrik attempted some pathetic coded whisper with the stiff-backed butler. Oh, the predictability! We _insisted_ on accompanying him to fetch dear [[Thalamra Vanthampur|Thelamra]]. As we stood there, a flicker of movement in the periphery caught my eye – a subtle distortion in the air. Just the barest warning before chaos erupted. [[Thurstwell Vanthampur]]'s nasty little infernal imps, lurking invisibly in every corner, decided to join the party.

As they shimmered into view, stingers bared, [[Amrik Vanthampur|Amrik]] made a desperate, foolish bid for freedom, scrambling towards the front door. _Tsk, tsk._ I intercepted him with a swift, decisive slash. We _had_ warned him about funny business. He really should have listened. His brief, treacherous life ended there on the polished front stoop. Meanwhile, the butler, showing slightly more sense, bolted for a side door. [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]], quick with his staff, hooked the fleeing servant's ankle, sending him sprawling ignominiously in the hallway beyond.

My blade sang as I cleaved the nearest imp neatly in two – such fragile things, really. I then darted across the room to assist [[Thomus - Thomas]], who was already gleefully trading blows with another of the little devils. All this delightful commotion naturally attracted attention. Three guards materialized in the hallway where the butler had fallen, three more burst through an eastern door, and another trio approached the main entrance from outside. Quick as a viper strike, [[Reya Mantlemorn]] dragged [[Amrik Vanthampur|Amrik's]] cooling corpse back inside and slammed the heavy door bolts home.

Then, a moment of beautiful synergy: [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] placed a hand upon [[Thomus - Thomas]]'s shoulder, and suddenly, our brawny companion unleashed a torrent of dragon fire! The inferno utterly consumed the imp we'd been fighting _and_ the three unfortunate guards who'd chosen the wrong door to burst through. Glorious immolation! Not to be outdone, [[Iliran Tilorri - Mike]] clapped his hands, sending the three guards in the hallway tumbling like ninepins against the far wall with a _thunderwave_. Amidst the chaos, the butler seemed to have vanished. [[Thomus - Thomas]] and [[Baktha Tassup - Ryan]] waded into the stunned guards in the hall, each felling one with brutal efficiency. The sole survivor turned tail and fled deeper into the mansion's bowels.

From outside, frantic pounding began against the main door. [[Reya Mantlemorn]], thinking quickly, shouted a rather creative warning: implying that [[Amrik Vanthampur|Amrik]] himself was barring the door and that forcing it would surely tear his arms off. The pounding ceased abruptly. Silence descended upon the entrance hall, thick with the smell of ozone, burnt flesh, and spilled blood. Deliciously eerie.
