Reya Mantlemorn, a paladin of Torm, trained near [[Elturel]]. She witnessed the city's horrifying disappearance, saw the Companion's light extinguish as [[Elturel]] seemingly crumbled into nothingness. Returning to the site, she found only a crater where the holy city once stood. Gathering survivors, she led a band of refugees to [[Baldur's Gate]] just before the gates slammed shut. When [[The Flaming Fist]] descended upon her desperate flock, they scattered. Cornered by a guard, Reya defended herself, lethally, and was now a fugitive.

Her sole focus: unraveling the mystery of [[Elturel]]'s vanishing. Whispers in the shadows led her to a rumor: [[Thabius Kreeg]], [[Elturel]]'s High Overseer, was supposedly hiding in [[Baldur's Gate]], associating with the Vanthampur family. Reya suspected his involvement in her city's doom.
