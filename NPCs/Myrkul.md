**Myrkul** (pronounced:  _MER-kul_) was a god of the dead and later a god of decay and exhaustion in the [Faerûnian pantheon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBnian_pantheon "Faerûnian pantheon").  He was originally a mortal man, a [necromancer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Necromancer "Necromancer") named **Myrkul Bey al-Kursi**, who ascended to [godhood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Gods "Dark Gods") alongside [Bhaal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bhaal "Bhaal"), the god of murder, and [Bane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bane "Bane"), god of tyranny. His portfolio and home, the [Bone Castle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Castle "Bone Castle"), were both usurped by the mortal [Cyric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cyric "Cyric") and later passed on to the ascended [Kelemvor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kelemvor "Kelemvor"). However, as that which is dead can never truly die, Myrkul was worshiped as a god once more in the 15th century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), **the Reaper** who brought more souls for the new Lord of the Dead to judge. The face of the **Lord of Bones**, the white skull shrouded in a black cowl, was recognized across the Realms as the symbol of fear and death, the paragon of nightmares.
